TweetBoard - Twitter Dashboard for "Pearls of Computer Science"
===============================================================

Starting September 2013, the [University of Twente](http://utwente.nl/en/) gradually introduces [project-based learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project-based_learning) in all bachelor-level courses. Moreover, for the first course, a university-wide theme has been chosen: sports. The [Computer Science bachelor program](http://www.utwente.nl/bachelor/inf/) of University of Twente has chosen to focus on creating a Twitter monitoring dashboard for various stakeholders in the [Batavierenrace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batavierenrace), a 185-km student relay race in which over 8000 runners participate.

In the first course in the Computer Science program, we offer a fully-functioning Twitter monitoring dashboard written in JavaScript and Python for students to configure, adapt and extend. This Github site contains the source
